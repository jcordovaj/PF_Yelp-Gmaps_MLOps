I have had some terrible experiences with other vets in the area and this clinic is a breath of fresh air. And their prices are too! Every bit makes my often 45 min+ drive to/from their clinic worth it. One pup recently had surgery and they have been so amazing through the whole process with me and Max. And I've waiting so long to get their teeth cleaned because of the exxorbanant prices some vets charge and the horror stories. Not any longer! It's so nice to see my doggies pearly whites and fresh smelling breath for once!  Thank you Ty and team. \u2764"}

If you are \"busy\" schedule appointments for another day, it's literally that easy. Only schedule the amount of appointments your staff can complete given the hours in a work day, obviously using historical data about cancellations to pad that data. But seriously, four and a half hours to complete two under ten pound dogs haircuts and a wash of a third dog as a wash only is ridiculous and the haircuts were not close to the quality I'm accustomed to at this facility.\n\nUpdate, spoke to the owner and they are making it right, apologized for the bad haircut and are making it right. Giving me a free groom of both my dogs. Very professional response to my poor experience and I will update again once I return my dogs for a groom. I highly anticipate it to be good since it always was in the past. Currently updated to four stars and if all goes as expected I will definitely upgrade to five.\n\nJust picked up my dogs after the \"repair\" grooming. What can I say, absolutely phenomenal. The groomer Liane absolutely knocked it out of the park. Whatever the issue was before is resolved and I can highly recommend Janry for grooming and will definitely be returning with all three of my little guys for all my grooming needs."}
