She arranged for a sitter that was perfect for the kids. Johanna. She swam with them and played games. The first thing my son said was \"best sitter ever\". He doesn't really get left with a sitter often so he was a little apprehensive, she made him feel at home and they had a great time. Johanna also watched our dog!

My parents were out of town and could not babysit, so we did the boarding thing,\n\nAfter that experience, I vowed never to board my dog again, and it had nothing to do with the boarding facility.  The facility was awesome!  I paid for a private \"suite\" that had a TV tuned to Animal Planet (I am not kidding) and had a webcam so I could check up on my baby over the web.  Well, after spending most of my vacation glued to a computer screen hoping to catch glimpses of my dog doing stuff, I decided he was coming with me on every vacation from that point on.  \n\nWhen they opened up a Preppy Pets near my house, i was intrigued by the suite and webcam options and we decided to check them out.  Their place is top notch, and if for whatever reason I couldn't take my dog with me, this would be the only place I'd even consider leaving him.  They also have outstanding grooming services.   McKenna is their groomer, and she has magical hands.  She makes my baby beautiful every single time!   We used to have our dog groomed at Fluffy Puppies but switched to Preppy Pets as there was a certain procedure that we needed done each grooming that Fluffy Puppies wouldn't do.  It has something to do with the anal glands, and I'll leave it at that. :)\n\nI'm a stickler for where my dog hangs out, and in his old age on what he eats, what he wears, and what he plays with.  Preppy Pets helps me keep this promise and they are as good as it gets!"}

She turned our crazy 9 month lab/pit mix into a gentle loving dog.  My boyfriend and I could not control Mia because she was always hyper and also HAD food aggression.  Angel first started coming to the house when Mia was between 4-5 months old for 1 hour sessions for basic training.  Mia was constantly biting because of the teething phase she was going through and the helpful tips that Angel gave us were more than enough to count on my hands.  After every visit she would text us to check on how Mia is doing (she really cares!).  Later into the training we then focused on Mia's food aggression which turned out to be way more than we could handle at home.  We did the board and train for a month.  Mia came back a brand new dog.  Angel worked very hard this month, focusing on Mia's food aggression (we can practically eat out of the bowl with her now because the issue is resolved), her extra hyper activity, taking her on a number of public outings so she could meet people (she is very shy of new people).  Before the board and train we could never just sit down on the couch and watch TV without Mia biting us or jumping all over the couch, etc. and now she just lays there like a calm dog.  The board and train was over a month ago and Angel still checks on Mia and her progress.  I cannot thank Angel enough for what she's done with Mia."}

First, was Easter Day, 2011, when my cat ate a poisonous Easter Lilly. My poor boy required a 2 day hospital stay to receive IV fluids to flush out his kidneys until all of the toxins were out of his system, and then a few follow-up visits for blood work.  While the stay was obviously expensive (I think a little over $2K), it was, of course, worth it.  Since he was there for several days, I saw and spoke with several doctors during his hospitalization, and I am sorry I don't remember any of their names, but they were mostly all very good at informing me of everything going on and also easing my mind a bit.  There was one blond doctor I saw, again whose name I don't remember, who I though was a little snotty, but I only dealt with her once, luckily.\n\nThe second time I required RBVH's emergency services was last weekend when another cat of mine had what seems to have been an intestinal viral infection.  She was being followed by my regular vet via phone, but I hadn't felt the need to take her in yet, until she took a turn for the worse on a Friday night.  There was no way I could wait til Monday to see my regular vet, so we went to RBVH around 10:00 PM.  My cat was treated by Dr. Marc Speiz (sp?) who was kind to both me and my cat, and informed me of all of his thoughts throughout the exam, the various options for treatment, and allowed me to make a fully informed decision as to the treatment plan.  Ultimately, things turned out well, she was treated and released that night, and the she has since made a full recovery.  \n\nI hope I do not require RBVH's services any time again in the future, but if, God forbid, something should come up with one of my pets again, I know I can trust these doctors any time of the day or night."}

I took her to an emergency animal clinic in the middle of the night, who recommended a ton of medication for the rest of my dog's life and told me she'd have a hard time walking again. They sent the info to Dr. Fransen who called the next day to check on my dog and told me she preferred only one, milder medication (also significantly cheaper), but said medication wasn't required, it was my choice if I felt comfortable with the slight chance she'd have another seizure. It's been almost a year since the seizure and my dog is doing great. She has no issues walking and most people can't believe how old she is.

Wild Birds Unlimited in Cherry Hill is such a shop. Having no experience  with  backyard bird feeding I went to this shop for the first time last week. It was packed with patrons. Within a few minutes I understood why. \n\nKarin, one of the  associates, spent   time patiently  explaining everything a novice like myself needed to know in order to get started. She was genuinely interested and very encouraging, making me feel that, yes, I could succeed at placing and maintaining a bird feeder that would attract the birds I want visiting my backyard and also how to deter pesky squirrels looking for a treat. \n\nI observed that the other two associates in this shop were equally engaged with clientele. Nice! I completed my purchase and was given a beginner guide and a chart to help me identify the birds I hoped to see. \n\nThe best part of this story, of course, is that within 3 days I had regular visitors to the feeder and I am just delighted with my early success with my new hobby. I had originally thought to  visit a big box store , make a purchase and hope for the best. So very glad I listened to a friend who told me about Wild Birds Unlimited. Terrific shop."}

He needed to have his right middle toe on his right front leg amputated so that the cancer wouldn't spread and in return save his life. Id like to give a special shout out to the veterinarians and surgeons who assisted in providing excellent care to my dog Rocky. *Dr. Higgins (Veterinarian 1st  consult) and his also excellent surgeon *Dr. Arulpragasam (Surgeon whom did his surgery). You both did a fantastic job and thank you very much! The front desk people are super nice as well as all of the vet techs and veterinarians we dealt with when there. We also visited the Maple Shade location to have his sutures taken out. Dr. Sarowitz (Surgeon whom took his sutures out) You too did a fantastic job and thank you! Rocky even thanked you with several kisses. I thank you too! I just can't say enough good about North Star and their employees. Rocky is doing great thanks to North Star Vets and up and running around again as if nothing even happened to him. Thank you so much for all that you did for my dog Rocky and my family. I highly recommend them for all of your pets medical care needs. 5 Stars! Sincerely, Holly, Michael, and Anthony Sollecito AND Rocky says thank you too. Woof!

The staff is incredibly friendly and always helpful.  That said, my review here is primarily targeted at how they label their sale merchandise in the stores.  My partner and I recently traveled here to purchase dog food...we buy Wellness.  Wellness brand is relatively expensive food, so savings are pretty important when you stumble upon them.  We usually buy the 55-60lb bags for three small pups.  When we recently ventured to the store to buy the food, my partner had a $2 off coupon, and we noted when arriving to the shelf housing the bags that there was another $2 off promotion.  Now, I will say this.  In general, when you are in a grocery store or any store that stocks shelves with like items and there is a sale, 9 times out of ten the store will paper the shelves with tags stating whatever the promotion may be.  For instance, in a freezer for Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream (there are at the very least 20 flavors) beneath each flavor is a tag reading some sort of promotion- 2 for $4.99 (you get the picture) and there are at the very least 20 tags denoting each item.   Well the same was the case for the dog food.  A tag about every 6 inches noting the sale...with the smaller bags and the larger bags.  So, in an instance like this we did not read the small print because quite simply, just about every square inch of the shelf was tagged with the promotion.  So, we thought- AWESOME SAUCE...coupon + additional savings equals $4.00 off! YAY.  Well we get to the counter only to find out that we were wrong,  the fine print only referred to the SMALL bags of food, but at the time, the sale tags were everywhere.  I guess the lesson in  all of this is for consumers to read the fine print,  and for stores to be forth coming and to be honest in their marketing,  you cannot always rely on that fact.  I would suggest that this store and others be more diligent in their practices and I will bring my reading glasses more often when shopping Pet Supermarket."}

We've been going to this location for the past 20 or so years (think Rosenberg days) and our chart is pages upon pages long with multiple dogs (at times 3 dogs under their care), 4 euthanized dogs, multiple hospital stays, thousands upon thousands of dollars in care, and they insulted me this morning by making me pay them $1,300 upfront before they would even operate on her. I can understand that for customers with limited or no history, but I don't walk out of that place with a bill generally less than $250 - $500 and to ask me for a deposit is shameless and insulting to me. Very bad business practice to ask for deposits from your best customers. Really is a shame that they care more about the dollar than your pet. It's all Red Bank big business and shows we're just dollars and cents to them. So might be time to look for a smaller practice that shows more compassion and understanding then simply caring about the almighty dollar and insulting a very good long time customer.\n\nUPDATE: I did complain to their customer relations person and she was very apologetic and said they would talk with their ownership and the front desks to use more common sense in these matters. She told me if it was her office she wouldn't have insisted on the deposit when I questioned it because of my being a long standing customer. They also put their money where their mouth was by giving me a customer loyalty discount on the entire surgical bill. My dog just got her cone off and she is very happy. My issue was never about the care my dogs receive."}

Finally I decided to bring him to Dr. Greek for her diagnosis.  She was able to confirm he had a bacterial skin infection and prescribed a medicated shampoo that has significantly improved his condition.  The visit was quite expensive, about $20 for the shampoo but over $200 for her expertise.  That said, I am glad to have a solution to Johnnie's problem and I'm glad it could be done in one visit and that she was very knowledgeable and understanding.

My second appointment the groomer was late. Her truck had apparently lost water and she asked me if I knew where she could fill it up. This is something she should have been asking her boss, because I had no clue. \n\nStill, I scheduled a third appointment. 2 days before my 3rd appointment I received an unsolicited 'We miss you' email from Hydrodog with no unsubscribe link. I emailed and asked to be unsubscribed. No response. \n\nThe day of my appointment the groomer calls to say she'll be late, again. I email hydrodog again and tell them that 1. they need to have an unsubscribe link and to please remove me 2. that it reflects poorly on them as a business to perpetually be late. The manager called me back and left me a message that basically stated 'the email you didn't like was an automated message, I changed the date from 45 days to 65 days. I talked to the groomer about her lateness and it's raining, and of course you know we can't help with that. It take a lot longer to groom dogs when it's humid and raining out. So she's doing the best she can but that's just the nature of the business when it comes to mobile. We try to do the best we can with scheduling but there are things that we cannot account for. The groomer would be happy to reschedule if that would be better for you and if you have time. Or, you could make your appointment the very first one of the day and then you never have to worry about her being late. Those are some options and if you need to talk to me here's my number.'\n\nSo I called her back because I wanted to explain that even if it's an automated message, it's still got to be FTC compliant.\nI also said, 'I also wanted to let you know that I understand it's raining and that sometimes people will be late, but if the groomer is late 2 out of 3 appointments, it gives the appearance that she's always going to late. That could mean the scheduling isn't being done correctly. It could also mean that if they're running that far behind someone needs to be rescheduled. Regardless, I don't want to set a precedent that it's acceptable to always be late for appointments with me.'\nShe said, 'well, that's just the nature of the mobile business.'\nAnd I said, 'well, then I probably need to take my business elsewhere.'\n\n* I don't think it's ok to always be late. Everyone might be late once in a while, due to unforseen circumstances. If you're perpetually late, you know why you're late.\n*  I don't think it's ok to schedule appointments so closely together so that your groomers are always late.\n* I don't think it's ok to brush off a customer's valid concerns over making sure that they're not signed up for a mailing list that they didn't subscribe to. I had no confirmation from the company that I'd been removed from such mailings.  Additionally, I went to the extra effort to let you know that it wasn't FTC compliant, and you just brushed that off.\n*  I don't think that if I had rescheduled that the groomer would have been on time for the rescheduled appointment, either.\n\nI don't feel that my time was valued. I definitely don't feel that I was valued as a customer. I'm really disappointed in my experiences with HydroDog. I do not recommend their services."}

I used to check the cameras when I first started taking my dog here but don't bother any more, I know she's having fun and being well taken care of. I've left her for as long as three weeks at this location while traveling abroad and never had any problems. The staff cares for her as if she was their own, they are friendly, considerate and take the time to understand and work with your pet's needs. Safe clean facility. Best doggie day care in my experience."}

I only have one sight negative/concern that may not be entirely valid, see bottom.\n\n Unfortunately, I had 0 had to be here 2x in a week. One was for my cat who got sent here by the regular vet because her kidney values were very high and they thought she might need hospitalized for fluids, etc. (Thankfully she did not.)  Considering it was \"emergency,\" with the visit, meds, etc it wasn't too bad price wise.\n\nThe second was for a feral cat in a colony I help with. We found him immobile in one of the shelters and while he sadly had to be put down, at least Garden State was able to humanely euthanize him and not leave him suffering.\n\nBoth visits the staff were friendly, fast and efficient. The vets and tech have are very caring toward the pets.\n\nNow one of my others (I have 4) just got diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. I'm considering the radio iodine treatment, and if I move forward will most likely choose Garden State.\n\nMy only hesitation for an emergency situation is that both times the emergency vets seem like it couldn't have been too long since they graduated.  While they both seemed knowledeable and were certainly caring, in a true medical emergency I think I would expect/hope for somebody more experienced.\n\nOverall, really terrific place and team.  T"}

Intrigued, we went inside to find out more and see what exactly a cat cafe was. The girl who was working there was so welcoming, answering all of our questions happily and excitedly. You could tell she really loved her job. She told us how Cat Therapy was an adoption center for cats who had been rescued from kill shelters. They offered an hour play time with the cats and kittens, as well as organized events such as Happy Meow'r and Cat Yoga. We opted to sign up for Sunday Cat Yoga. The yoga class wasn't challenging, and would be considered more of a basic yoga class, but it was one of the most relaxing and fun yoga classes I've ever taken. The cats are free to roam around, so as we were doing our downward dogs and chatarungas (or should I say CAT-arungas), the kitties would run underneath you, rub against your arms and legs, and sniff at your curiously. A few of the kittens even fell asleep on top of the class goers during savasana, myself included. It was a truly happy and stressful hour and I would definitely recommend to any cat lover. One of the more unique things I've done in a long time!"}

I have even brought several of my mom's cats here after they had been receiving inferior treatment elsewhere and now those pets are healthy and thriving. One cat had severe mouth ulcers and gingivitis which was not responding to the medications another vet had prescribed. He was near to dying from starvation when I brought him in for emergency care. Dr. Collier kept him on medications and close observation for several months, did a full dental extraction and now the cat is healthy, happy and regaining weight. Another young kitten I brought in had a severe eye ulcer which another vet would only treat by removing the eye. Dr. Magazu performed a procedure which allowed the kitten to keep the eye and retain most of his vision. \n\nI also appreciate that while surgery expenses are high (similar to other facilities), follow-up check up appointments are not expensive. \n\nMy one quibble is I have sometimes had difficulty getting results back from diagnostic testing without repeated calls trying to chase down staff. I realize they are a busy practice but sometimes it can be frustrating waiting on results."}

Walking into any pet store and not having a pungent smell is marvelous. We went in this past Saturday looking for pet Halloween costumes --(thanks again Rachel M, for the tip) considering the amount of people browsing the store that day they still had a huge selection of items on clearance. An employee named Don Grady answered all of our questions and made a few suggestions. Be sure to join their \"Pet Perks\" program -- they send out emails, which you can customize to send you alerts when your favorite brands go on sale. You'll also get members-only coupons as a Pet Perks card benefit, and your pet gets a treat on his or her birthday.\n\nThis location offers grooming, veterinarian office, training classes and cat adoption services. (Located in the Grove at Wesley Chapel -- off of State Road 56 and Oakley Boulevard). They have supplies for dogs, cats, birds, reptile, fish and small pets.  There are fish for sale as well as birds, lizards, guinea pigs, etc. Looks like they have a huge selection of different foods and supplies for whatever pet you own. Opened Monday through Saturday 9 to 9 and on Sunday from 10 to 6 (grooming and vet have different hours. Check out their website for more information on clearance, adoptions and/or store events: http://stores.petsmart.com/1609 \n\nOne suggestion I do have for management while you do offer baggies and disposal for pet waste -- the outside areas need to be policed and better maintained. There is way too much pet excrement (land mines) on the sidewalks and in the shrub areas."}

My regular vet was out of the country, so I called this local vet and asked them, \"do you treat guinea pigs?\"  (Not many vets do, as they are considered \"exotics\" and their medical needs are VERY different than cats and dogs).  The girl responded, \"Uh... yeah!\" like she had to think about it.  This made me nervous, but I was stuck with my regular vet being away, so I brought her in.  As a side-effect of my guinea pig's underlying illness, she had urine scald on her behind, and I needed something to treat it.  The vet looked her over and gave me a topical powder-like medication for her skin.  Still feeling a little uneasy about this vet's ability to treat my pet, I researched the medication before applying it to my guinea pig's skin.  Good thing I did, because while it was a common medication for skin conditions in cats and dogs, it was poisonous to guinea pigs.  Needless to say, I did not use that medication, and continued with the OTC treatment I had been using until my regular vet was back and could see my Camilla. \n\nThis vet may be good for cats and dogs, but they need to know where to draw the line if they are not properly experienced in treating other animals.  I would not go back here for any reason, any pet."}

The fact that they call the dogs \"campers\" and themselves \"camp counselors\" is adorable. \n\nI'm giving them 4 out of 5 stars because they're a little pricey for what they offer. They're slightly less expensive than Royal Pet's Market but the facilities don't even compare! Camp Bow Wow consists of a few play areas (no grass, or even faux grass, that I can remember) and the dogs sleep in caged kennels with a bed frame made out of PVC tubing with a cushion on top. Very bare bones when compared with RPM, which is only marginally more expensive but the facilities are a thousand times nicer!\n\nOf course, despite the lack of \"cuteness\", the dogs are happy and safe, which is what matters in the long run. However, I think I'll continue making the drive to RPM. I don't like to think of my babies inside of a chain link kennel."}

The Pocono Pet Nanny's Bed and Biscuit is probably one of the nicest and cleanest places I have ever seen.There are several themed rooms along with beds, TVs and music playing.

I had such peace of mind!\n\nPrior to booking our dogs' stay, Jan was great at communicating with us and never hesitated to answer my (many, many) questions.

She and her staff are \"pet people\" and truly have love and compassion for animals. \n\nOur family never traveled because we did not want to leave our dogs, but I have a feeling our visit with the Pocono Pet Nanny might change things for us.

We had the opportunity to work with Dr. Saladino when our dog, Bijoux,became ill unexpectedly. Together we had to make some tough decisions about his illness and eventually end of life care. The end of life care was one of the hardest decisions we ever had to make. I could feel Dr. Saladino's pain and the  pain in the hearts of the office staff during this time. They were a great support and performed this task respectful, kind, dignified and loving to our dog and ourselves. Knowing it was the right choice did not make it an easy one, but everyone supported us. The staff made a paw print so we can remember Bijoux in a good way and in happier times.  I highly recommend this practice. The doctors and staff will take good , loving care of your pet."}

It makes it that much more enjoyable of an experience. I think the cats would much rather be there than in a shelter setting, given the amount of attention they get and the overall coziness of the place. Also, they will give you a freebie if you come in for your birthday, which I thought was sweet.\n\nSome improvements could be made: \n-More comfy furniture for the humans (maybe some couch chairs to lounge on?). \n-I would be more inclined to choose Cat Therapy as a hangout spot if coffee and treats were actually made and served there, rather than the employees having to go pick up food and drink items from a different cafe to bring back to you.\n-When your 75 minutes is almost up, an employee will come remind you that it is time to leave soon, unless you would like to pay to stay longer. This is awkward and I feel could be done much better. It would be nice to have a clock in system set up to where the customers clock in when they arrive, clock out when they leave, and pay however much is due at the end."}

In fact, my mom left the store with me asking if I could switch my tank to saltwater because of how much she liked what she saw.\nHowever -- I DID notice that all the tanks were on a central filtration system, which worried me. They may have quarantine tanks that are not on display, but even then if one fish got sick, ALL the other fish would get sick too, not just one tank. I will probably ask about this next time I stop by. \n!!ALWAYS quarantine your fish for at least a week before you put them in your tank regardless of where they come from!!"}

Then to top it off she asked to sign a consent for shaving the dog as if at this point I had a choice.

We took our four dogs there at the last minute along with special request.  Josh was happy to accommodate us. They double washed and conditioned our big long coated shepherd for normal pricing so I tipped an extra 15. These are real dog lovers with very fair pricing. We will be coming back in a few weeks for touch ups."}

Another major plus for me is that a lot of the items I usually purchase are priced competitively and in some cases lower priced than most of their competitors. \nThis will be my pet store of choice if I'm needing anything and am in the area."}

All the cats there come from local shelters and are adoptable. You get to meet all of the cats and observe their temperament while interacting with them to see if you find a match. The facility is clean and offer a comfortable environment for the cats. We indeed found our new family addition there at our initial visit and the staff made the adoption process very easy and seamless. They had the cat's health and vet profiles ready for us to review and went over tips on how to introduce our new kitty to our home. \n\nCat Therapy is such a wonderful concept! I would absolutely recommend anyone that is looking for a cat to check this place out. We were able to glean from our experience that the staff truly care about having these cats find good, loving homes and I wish them continued success."}

The staff is very friendly and accommodating and this is the first groomer I've been to where I've had a complete, un-rushed consultation with the groomer prior to starting. Both groomers that I've used (Sheila and Erika) are very experienced and did a fantastic job. Five stars is really hard to get but they deserve it. Highly recommend."}

First visit was ok, they seem to be really on the anti-social side, as by which i mean they dont greet you as you enter the building at all!\n\nCalled again a few weeks later to learn more about flea meds and happen to have some lady answer. I tried asking her a few questions then comes at me with \"I dont work at the clinic, im sorry but i cant help you because i really have to go to an administrative appointment\" And i try asking her to direct me and still comes at me with \"I really have to go!\" I ask again and then says \"i can try but i dont know if they'll answer\" REALLY LADY??!?! JUST TRANSFER ME TO ANOTHER PERSON!!! OR you could've offered to redirect me to someone else so you can go to your appointment! I donated and also have a membership to go to this clinic!!! Seriously made me instantly annoyed that this lady was so ballsy to be so rude and just try cut me off. Couldn't even answer my questions or even ask me if i was a member. She made things a whole lot more complicated with not being able to get the flea meds i wanted. \nOnce i reached out to someone else, that person was really nice and helpful. Im sure it was the same lady to gave me the flea meds for my dogs. I don't know if i wanna come back after my membership ends. I just am able to afford their prices than with my old vet..."}

Despite his less than sunny demeanor, the folks here do such a great job with him. Dr. Sclarsky is pretty no nonsense and, as a result our dog usually relents and allows his exams (etc) to proceed. If it weren't for her, I'm convinced our boy wouldn't even be with us today. He became really ill over a year ago and we thought the time had come to make that tough decision to let him go and end his suffering. Dr. Sclarsky encouraged us to do one more test, just to be sure we felt we had sufficiently exhausted our options (and so that we would feel better about making that tough decision). It turned out  he had a condition that could be managed (and has been for almost 1.5 years). Dr. Sclarsky is great about following up quickly with results and monitoring what is (isn't) normal for our dog (and treating accordingly).\n\nThis is the best veterinary practice we've gone to. Even though my dog is a jerk, I still love him:). It's great to have full trust in the person who is caring for one of my family members."}

Rushed him over to RBVH Cherry HIll.  Total charge for sedation, cleaning wound and inserting drain was $618. which included a $140 Level IV \"Emergency Exam\".  I was so happy to have gotten the cat seen quickly and on road to recovery I didn't think twice about the cost at the time.  However, they also instructed that the drain should be removed within 3-5 days and the sutures at the site of abscess would need removing after 7-10 days. \nI called on the 3rd day to see if I could make an appointment to have the drain removed the next day.  Was told \"no appointment needed, just call an hour before you want to come to make sure we're not swamped\" So the next day I called, spoke to someone else, and was told sure I could bring cat in and that I would be charged as an \"Emergency Exam\"...the fee?  YUP!  Another $140.  When I questioned why the follow up was also classified as \"emergency\" I was told bluntly that I could bring the cat to my own vet.  So... that is what I did, and the fee?  No charge!  Guess Maple Shade Animal Hospital didn't find the task quite so complex."}
